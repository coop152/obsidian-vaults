## Classes of Problems
- **P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time (e.g. $O(n^c)$)
- **NP**: problems that are **verifiable** in polynomial time, or are solvable in polynomial time **by a non-deterministic machine**. **P** is a subset of **NP**.
- **NP-Hard**: Problems that are at least as hard as every problem in **NP**.
- **NP-Complete**: Problems that are in both **NP** and **NP-Hard**.

## Reductions
You have two problems $A$ and $B$, and you know how to solve $B$.
(this shit doesnt make sense)
