A solution to some computational problems that involves three steps:
1. Divide the problem into subproblems, each being a smaller instance of the same problem ($D(n)$)
2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just straightforwardly solve the subproblems $(aT(\frac{n}{b}))$
3.
