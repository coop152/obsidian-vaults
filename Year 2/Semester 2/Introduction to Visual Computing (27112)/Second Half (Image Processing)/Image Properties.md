## Resolution
**Spacial Resolution** is the regular, commonly used measure of resolution. An image has a fixed resolution in pixels with a width and height.
**Angular Resolution** is another measure that gives the detail of an image in terms of how much of the field of view each pixel occupies.

This takes into account the focal length of the camera. For example, an image with the same spatial resolution but taken with a telephoto (narrow angle) lens will have a lower angular resolution. With angular resolution, a smaller value means more detail for objects.
**Ground Resolution** is a specialised measure of resolution for aerial photography. It represents the amount of detail that is captured at a certain distance and spacial resolution.

If the ground resolution is greater than the size of the object you are trying to capture, it will not appear in the image.

**Intensity Resolution** (or Colour Depth) is the number of colours that a pixel can be in an image.

## Noise
Under certain conditions, a camera will capture images with false detail called noise. This is often under low-light conditions, as the camera must either take in more light or digitally brighten the image.

One measure of noise is the **Signal to Noise ratio**.
