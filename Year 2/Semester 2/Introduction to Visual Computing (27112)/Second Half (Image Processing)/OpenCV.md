An easy-to-use, open source API for Computer Vision originally developed by Intel. Has bindings for:
- C/C++
- Python
- Android
- iOS

Here is a simple example program:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230309145552.png)
This simply takes in the image "harley.jpg", applies a threshold effect, then writes it to a new file.
Here is an example program demonstrating iteration through pixels:
![](Pasted%20image%2020230309145801.png)
This is similar to the previous example, but with a manually implemented threshold function that ignores a certain rectangle of the image.
