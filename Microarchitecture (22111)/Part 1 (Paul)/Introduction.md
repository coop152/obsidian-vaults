## Definitions
**Abstraction**: Hiding the complexity of the design.

**Hierarchical Approach**: Breaking the design up into smaller, more manageable elements.

**Specification**: Defines all of the requirements and features of the design. Doesn't necessarily include technical details (i.e. may be an abstraction).

**Top-down Design**: Designing a specification first, and elaborating on the specific implementation later; begins completely abstract and becomes more concrete as the design progresses.

**Bottom-up Design**: Begin the design with the lowest-level components (e.g. transistors) and bring these smaller components together.
