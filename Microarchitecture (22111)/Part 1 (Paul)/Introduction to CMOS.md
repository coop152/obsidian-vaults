## Formulae
#### Current, Voltage and Resistance (Ohm's Law)
$I$ is the current, measured in Amps (A).
V is the voltage, measured in Volts (V).
R is the resistance, measured in Ohms ($\ohm$).
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$V = IR$$
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
#### Capacitance, Charge, Voltage
C is the capacitance, measured in Farads (F).
Q is the charge, measured in Coulombs (C).
V is the voltage, measured in Volts (V).
$$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$
$$Q = CV$$
$$V = \frac{Q}{C}$$
#### Parallel vs Series
| Measurement | Parallel                                        | Series                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Voltage     | $V_T = V_1 = V_2$                               | $V_T = V_1 + V_2$                               |
| Current     | $I_T = I_1 + I_2$                               | $I_T = I_1 = I_2$                               |
| Resistance  | $\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$ | $R_T = R_1 + R_2$                               |
| Capacitance | $C_T = C_1 + C_2$                               | $\frac{1}{C_T} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$ |

In words:

The total voltage is equal to the sum of all voltages in series.
The total current is equal to the sum of the currents on each parallel wire.
The current across a wire in series is the same as the total current.
The total resistance is equal to the sum of all resistances in series.
In parallel, the reciprocal of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the resistances on each parallel wire.
The total capacitance is equal to the sum of all capacitances in parallel.
In series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of all the capacitances along the wire.
