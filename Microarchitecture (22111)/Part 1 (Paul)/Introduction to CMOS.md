## Formulae
#### Current, Voltage and Resistance (Ohm's Law)
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$V = IR$$
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
#### Resistors in Series
Current stays the same across the whole circuit when resistors are in series; voltage changes locally at the location of the resistors.
$$R_T=\sum{R_i}$$
i.e. "The total resistance of a circuit is the sum of all the resistances in series"
e.g.
$$V_s = \sum{V_{R_i}}$$
i.e. "The sum of the voltages across every resistor is equal to the voltage of the power source"

#### Resistors in Parallel
Voltage stays the same across the whole circuit when resistors are parallel; the current changes locally
$$\frac{1}{R_T} = \sum{\frac{1}{R_i}}$$
i.e. "The "
