## Formulae
#### Current, Voltage and Resistance (Ohm's Law)
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$V = IR$$
$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
#### Parallel vs Series
| Measurement | Parallel                                        | Series                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Voltage     | $V_T = V_1 = V_2$                               | $V_T = V_1 + V_2$                               |
| Current     | $I_T = I_1 + I_2$                               | $I_T = I_1 = I_2$                               |
| Resistance  | $\frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$ | $R_T = R_1 + R_2$                               |
| Capacitance | $C_T = C_1 + C_2$                               | $\frac{1}{C_T} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$ |

In words:
The voltage on each parallel wire is the same as the total voltage.
The total voltage is equal to the sum of all voltages in series.
The total current is equal to the sum of the current on each parallel wire.
The current is always equal to the total current across a wire.
