# Savitch's Theorem
Savitch's theorem shows that deterministic machines can simulate nondeterministic machine using only polynomially more space. That is, if a nondeterministic Turing machine uses $f(n)$ space then a deterministic Turing machine exists to simulate it which only uses $f^2(n)$ space.
