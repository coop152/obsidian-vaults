Simple:
You have a system of linear equations $\epsilon$ with a positive real solution. Let $m$ be the number of entries in that solution that are positive.
Suppose we have a solution $e$ with the minimum possible number of non-zero values (i.e. the most zero values possible). Let $n$ be the number of non-zero values.
Throw away every variable in $\epsilon$ that has a zero value in $e$; now $\epsilon$ has $n$ variables and the solution is of length $n$.
If $m < n$ (that is, if the number of positive solutions is less than the number of non-zero solutions)
