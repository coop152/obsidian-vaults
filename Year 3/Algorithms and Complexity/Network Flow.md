Consider a computer network modelled by a digraph $G$. Each vertex represents a computer, each edge represents a one-way communication channel from one computer to another, and the weight of each edge represents the *bandwidth* of that channel (i.e. the maximum number of bytes that can be sent along that channel per second.)
Suppose we want to send a high-bandwidth stream
