# Raytracing
A ray is line with an origin and a direction in 3D space.

A ray can be represented simply as two column vectors.
Assuming the ray's direction vector is normalised, you can perform a multitude of useful linear algebra calculations about the behaviour of the ray in a 3D space.
For example, if you want to find a point along the ray at some distance $t$, you can use this equation:

Which is called the explicit equation of the ray.
