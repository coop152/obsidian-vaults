Spatial Enumeration (or Spatial Partitioning) techniques are used to organise space in ways that accelerate the commonly used computer graphics calculations can be done more quickly.
These calculations are not the low-level matrix/vector calculations - GPU hardware already has those incredibly optimised. The calculations optimised by spatial enumeration are higher level operations on higher level data structures.
# Database analogy
Imagine we're building a database to hold information about animals. We start off by just putting the names of the animals into the database in no particular order
