- Wrote some very quick and dirty code for the "delete everything before date" feature. In total, i implemented these things for this feature to work:
	- `ical_deleteallbefore` in `actions.tcl`
	- `dg_date` in `tcllib`, which required some interesting extra work in the form of `update_day_maximum` to keep the upper bound of the day selector matched to the month and year
