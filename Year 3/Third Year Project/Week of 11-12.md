- First thing: move the history mode into the tcl. DONE
- Then, make the window change colour when in delete history mode (or at least indicate in some other way)
- Also change the menu option for viewing history to a tick-box.
- Implement the expected clipboard behaviour, maybe swap the shortcuts so delete is on ctrl+x.
