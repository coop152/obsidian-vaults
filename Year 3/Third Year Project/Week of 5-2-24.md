- Working on making it more obvious when the calendar is in delete mode
	- Make something on the window very obviously go red
	- Make it very obviously say that it's in delete history mode
	- Actually make the softdelete/restore button change label so you can tell what it does
- New bug discovered, making repeating appointments straight up crashes the program. Turns out this is where that infinite recursion warning comes into play!
