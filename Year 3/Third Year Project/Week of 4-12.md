- Add keyboard shortcut and option in context menu for deleting to the history
- Added "View Delete History" option in File menu that displays deleted items. You can't restore them individually yet, but you can do everything you could do with a normal item to them.
- As of yet not done:
	- Change the colour of the window (to do this i probably need to store the historyMode in the Tcl)
