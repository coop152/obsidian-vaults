- Started by investigating some existing regular events in the program, to determine how auto-purge could be triggered. First I investigated the daily auto-switch, which moves the calendar to the next day automatically at midnight (?) if its on the current day.
- I did it! Make a big writeup here about how I adapted the deleteallbefore function to work for autopurge by separating it out and such. This is the week where i completed autopurge!
	- WRITEUP GOES HERE
- [x] TODO: remember to actually change the dialog when the operation will delete zero items.
- [x] TODO: make the autopurge popups more descriptive. It should actually say that its autopurge. probably just need a new dialogue, cause having a "cancel" button on a dialogue that the user didn't open themselves is pretty odd.
- always remember that you can do `set errorInfo` in the terminal if the program crashes for no reason; it lets you actually see the error.
