- Started by investigating some existing regular events in the program, to determine how auto-purge could be triggered. First I investigated the daily auto-switch, which moves the calendar to the next day automatically at midnight (?) if its on the current day.
- I did it! Make a big writeup here about how I adapted the deleteallbefore function to work for autopurge by separating it out and such.
	- WRITEUP GOES HERE
- [x] TODO: remember to actually change the dialog when the operation will delete zero items.
- [x] TODO: make the autopurge popups more descriptive. It should actually say that its autopurge. probably just need a new dialogue, cause having a "cancel" button on a dialogue that the user didn't open themselves is pretty odd.
- [ ] Update those READMEs to include accurate descriptions of building for windows AND Linux! remember, Linux building got a whole lot easier with the port.
- [ ] check that the files still transfer readily between Linux and windows without any problems! (i.e. check the line endings aren't fucking everything up and ruining my life again)
- [ ] if there's time to spare, go through the code and really make sure you've removed all the legacy array types and old file API usages! that's one of the things I wanna say I did in the report!
	- Used this cool trick when converting Lexer to use std::string and fstream! https://stackoverflow.com/a/2602258
	- Lexer now has the input buffer stored as a std::string instead of a cstring. still very janky on account of the use of the home-baked charArray for a temp thing.
- [ ] And check for any more TODOs that you might have forgotten about.
- always remember that you can do `set errorInfo` in the terminal if the program crashes for no reason; it lets you actually see the error.
