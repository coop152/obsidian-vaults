- Started by investigating some existing regular events in the program, to determine how auto-purge could be triggered. First I investigated the daily auto-switch, which moves the calendar to the next day automatically at midnight (?) if its on the current day.
- I found it, but to really do this effectively im going to refactor my crappy code from last week first. This involved:
	- things
	- stuff
- [x] TODO: remember to actually change the dialog when the operation will delete zero items.
- [x] TODO: make the autopurge popups more descriptive. It should actually say that its autopurge. probably just need a new dialogue, cause having a "cancel" button on a dialogue that the user didnt open themselves is pretty odd.
- [ ] Update those READMEs to include accurate descriptions of building for windows AND linux! remember, linux building got a whole lot easier with the port.
- [ ] check that the files still transfer readily between linux and windows without any problems! (i.e. check the line endings arent fucking everything up and ruining my life again)
- [ ] if theres time to spare, go through the code and really make sure youve removed all the legacy array types and old file API usages! that's one of the things i wanna say i did in the report!
- always remember that you can do `set errorInfo` in the terminal if the program crashes for no reason; it lets you actually see the error.
