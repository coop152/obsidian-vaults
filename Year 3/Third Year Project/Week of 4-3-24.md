- Started by investigating some existing regular events in the program, to determine how auto-purge could be triggered. First I investigated the daily auto-switch, which moves the calendar to the next day automatically at midnight (?) if its on the current day.
- I found it, but to really do this effectively im going to refactor my crappy code from last week first. This involved:
	- things
	- stuff
- [ ] TODO: remember to actually change the dialog when the operation will delete zero items.
- always remember that you can do `set errorInfo` in the terminal if the program crashes for no reason; it lets you actually see the error.
