In the examplars section on blackboard
[saved here](hunskerken_report.pdf)

notably, the references are almost entirely websites. If it's good enough for them then it's good enough for me(?)

their verification/testing/whatever section is also really short, and "all" they did was create some test programs that exercised their operating system. might be good enough with ical to just make a manual test suite (that is, literally a list of things to try out to make sure they work) and maybe some tcl tests that exercise the interface with the C. idk how you do that but ??????
# Maybe use this to make the presentation for the screencast
