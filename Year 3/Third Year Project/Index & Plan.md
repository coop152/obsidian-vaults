- [ ] (?) Refactor code to use modern C++
	- [x] Use chrono for time
	- [ ] Replace most/all of the C style arrays with c++ style, most importantly strings (This includes the home-baked charArray class)
	- [ ] use modern file APIs
	- [ ] Resolve code safety warnings (remove `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` from preprocessor definitions to see them)
