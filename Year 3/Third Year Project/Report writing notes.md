# Todos (at some point)
- [ ] Write the abstract (probably when the overall structure is decided)
- [ ] figure out what's going in the appendix?


# Steps to take (in order)
- [ ] Decide the names of the sections and put them in the report (this will generate the table of contents too). For example:

- [ ] Just write something, anything, in each section. No expectation of completeness or even presentability, just get the facts down. Make sure every single section has something before you start cleaning anything up. Dont even look for accurate information if you need it, just put a TODO marker and come back for it later.
