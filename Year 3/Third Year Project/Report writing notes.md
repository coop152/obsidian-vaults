# Todos (at some point)
- [ ] Write the abstract, probably at the very end. it should summarise the entire project and list the key outcomes.
- [ ] figure out what's going in the appendix?
- [ ] Do I need a list of abbreviations?


# Steps to take (in order)
- [ ] Decide the names of the sections and put them in the report (this will generate the table of contents too). For example:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240318115805.png)
- [ ] Just write something, anything, in each section. No expectation of completeness or even presentability, just get the facts down. Make sure every single section has something before you start cleaning anything up. Dont even look for accurate information if you need it, just put a TODO marker and come back for it later.

# Sections
## Introduction
Probably wanna introduce what ical is (lol), including how old it is, and thus how outdated much of the code is.
State the aims of the project. that is, port the program to windows, and give the user a native windows-like experience, with an installer, a folder in program files... But to also have a linux version compiling from the same source, with the same native linux experience (i.e. gnu configure script and make install...)
Articulate how there wasn't much of an explicit plan, as much of the project involved investigating the existing code and discovering what needed to be changed/updated/added as I went along. More planning arised when I started adding features, but I still ended up doing quite a lot of code updating while adding said features so it was still mostly freeform.
FINALLY, provide a summarised roadmap to the following chapters of the report. This part will probably be pretty similar to other reports, so check the exemplars.
