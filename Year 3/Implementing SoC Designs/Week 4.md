# Design trade-offs
Given a specification, how do you decide on the perfect implementation?
Answer: There is no such thing. There are many ways to make something work, and many more ways to make something that doesn't work.
When picking an implementation, we want to consider it's qualities in this top-down order:
- Algorithms
- Architecture
- RTL
- Practicalities
	- Power supply
	- Cooling
	- Pad limitations
	- etc.
