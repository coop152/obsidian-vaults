# MOSFETs
MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Silicon Field Effect Transistors) are a three terminal device.
- Source - source of current (charge carriers)
- Drain - sink for current (charge carriers)
- Gate - voltage across the gate controls the current flow between source and drain

There is also a fourth terminal, the substrate, which is usually omitted from figures. 
MOSFETs come in two variants, p-channel (PMOS) and n-channel (NMOS).
The MOSFETs we use are **enhancement** mode devices, which are normally turned off completely until voltage on the gate **enhances** conduction.
MOSFETs are symmetric. There is no physical difference between the source and the drain - they are just labels. 

## Details
A MOSFET consists of a source contact and a drain contact separated by a channel. This channel is *doped* such that it will not conduct when a voltage is applied between the drain and source. The doping stops the channel from conducting because it has no charge carriers of the type produced by the source electrode. If a suitable voltage is applied between the gate and the source then an *electric field* is set up across the gate's oxide layer and a charge is induced in the channel. This charge consists of the same type of carriers as in the source, so the device can conduct from source to drain.
In an n-channel device, we have n-type doped source and drain contacts
