# Verification and Debugging
First, you should test the simple things:
- Does it reset?
	- Is the initial state achieved?
	- Are there unknowns in the circuit?
- Do the straightforward operations work properly?

When writing the later tests you should be sure:
- You test every statement
- You try to break it
