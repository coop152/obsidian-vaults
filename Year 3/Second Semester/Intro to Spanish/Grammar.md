# Pronouns
You use reflexive pronouns when an action is reflexive; that is, the subject is also the object (For example, he calls himself == "se llama").
You use object pronouns in any other case, where the action isn't reflexive. (for example, he likes == "le gusta")

Using gustar as an example:

| Person  | Reflexive | English                            | (Indirect) Object | English |
