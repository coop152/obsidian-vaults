K-means performs **hard clustering**. This means that each point is put into a single cluster with no leeway - you cannot have a point in two overlapping clusters, and there is no concept of a point being "strongly" or "weakly" in a cluster. For example, this clustering is not possible with k-means:

# Probabilistic Clustering
Probabilistic clustering performs **soft clustering**, in contrast with the **hard clustering** of k-means. Instead of just assigning each point to a cluster, we model each cluster as a Gaussian distribution. Any given point can lie in any number of clusters, and with a certain weight for each cluster depending on how close it is to the cluster's mean.
