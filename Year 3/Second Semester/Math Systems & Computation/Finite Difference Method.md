The **Finite Difference method** is another way of solving ODEs that is also capable of solving **boundary value** problems.
# Forward Difference Approximation
We have a function $f(x)$, and we want to estimate the derivative $f'(x)$. From the Taylor series, we know that:

If we subtract $f(x)$ and then divide by $h$:
