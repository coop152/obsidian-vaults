#### Recap: the camera analogy
If you want to take an image of something with a real life camera, you take these steps:
1. Arrange the subjects of the photo to create the desired composition
2. Position the camera to point at the scene
3. Choose a camera lens based on the angle, zoom, etc...
4. Decide on the final size of the photo
These steps are roughly analogous to 3D viewing:
1. Set the Modelling Transformation
2. Set the Viewing Transformation
3. Set the Projection Transformation
4. Set the Viewport Transformation

This page defines the Projection Transformation.

How do we map 3D world coordinates to 2D coordinates on a screen?
