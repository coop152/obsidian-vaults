1. The thresholds put bounds on the intensity gradient of each pixel, and with these decide if a pixel is a strong edge, a weak edge, or not an edge. The first argument is the lower threshold which sets a minimum value for the gradient intensity of a pixel. If a pixel's gradient is less than this, then it is rejected as an edge. The second argument is the upper threshold - if a pixel's gradient is greater than this then it is accepted as a strong edge, and will be included in the result as an edge. If a pixel's gradient lies in-between the two, then it is marked as a weak edge; these weak edges will only be classified as an edge if they are connected to a strong edge.
2. The `aperture` parameter defines the size of the Sobel kernel that is used to calculate the gradient intensities of the image. Increasing the size beyond 3 increases the area around each pixel that is considered when calculating the gradients, which smooths over noise but also increases the amount of detected edges.
