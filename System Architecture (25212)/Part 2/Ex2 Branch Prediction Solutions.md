1. 17.12% (1941 instructions) made up 90% of this program's execution time. I used the python script `ex1.py` to measure this, which sorts the instructions by number of executions in descending order and sums their execution counts until it exceeds 90% of the total, counting the number of instructions it took.
2. 428065 branches were taken.
3. 7.9986 instructions per branch.
4. 20% of execution time is wasted. The program takes 428065 branches, each of which wastes two cycles in addition to the cycle that it takes to execute. Therefore, the program runs for $\text{instructionCount} + 2\cdot\text{branchCount}$ cycles, which is 4280063 for the given trace. The proportion of wasted time is $\frac{2\cdot\text{branchCount}}{\text{totalTime}}$, which is almost exactly 20%.
5. 89.28% of the branches in the program are invariant.
