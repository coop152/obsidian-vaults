1. 17.12% (1941 instructions) made up 90% of this program's execution time. I used the python script `ex1.py` to measure this, which sorts the instructions by number of executions in descending order and sums their execution counts until it exceeds 90% of the total, counting the number of instructions it took.
2. 428065 branches were taken.
3. 7.9986 instructions per branch.
4. 20% of execution time is wasted. The program takes 428065
