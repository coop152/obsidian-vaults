## Binary Decision Tree (BDT)
The BDT is a data structure for verifying interpretations against a formula. It is more efficient and faster than a truth table.

Circle nodes represent a decision; the solid line means the variable is true, and the dotted line means it is false.
Square nodes are "terminal nodes"; they represent the final result of evaluating the formula at the given interpretation.
