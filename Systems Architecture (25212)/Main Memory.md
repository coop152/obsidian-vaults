## Random Access
Strictly speaking, in RAM any address should get the same treatment as any other. Access time should be *constant*, regardless of previous accesses or absolute location (but in practise this isn't always true).
This is in contrast to **serial access memory** (e.g. a tape reel) which has drastically varying access speeds depending on the address of the last access vs the current one.
## Static RAM (SRAM)
- Truly random access.
- Fairly compact.
- Low power, especially when not in use.
- Volatile: only holds data while powered.
- Can be manufactured with standard logic gates, making it amenable for use on logic chips.
- Extensively used.
## Layout implications for RAM
Bigger memories require longer wires, so they're slower and more power-hungry. Therefore, **bigger is slower, smaller is faster**.
