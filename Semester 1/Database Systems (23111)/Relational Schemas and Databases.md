## Assorted SQL Snippets
#### Filter by an Aggregate
given the table `SoldProducts` which has a list of products and individual prices for which they were sold, find all products that have sold more than Â£100 and that aren't in the "Technology" category.
```sql
SELECT name, category, SUM(price) FROM SoldProducts
WHERE category != "Technology" -- Filter by non-aggregates here
GROUP BY name
HAVING SUM(price) > 100; -- Filter by aggregates here
```
#### Stored Procedures
Simple example:
```sql
DELIMITER //    -- Change delimiter so that ; can be used in the procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllProducts()    -- Create the procedure
BEGIN
	SELECT * FROM Products;
END //    -- Using changed delimiter

DELIMITER ;    -- Change delimiter back to normal

-- later on...
CALL GetAllProducts();
```
Parameters:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetOrdersByDate(
	IN orderDate DATE,
	OUT orderCount INT)
BEGIN
	SELECT * FROM Orders
	WHERE Orders.date = orderDate;

	SELECT COUNT(*) INTO orderCount FROM Orders
	WHERE Orders.date = orderDate;
END

DELIMITER ;
```
List all stored procedures:
```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_type = "PROCEDURE" AND routine_schema = "classicmodels";
```
Control Flow, local variables:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerLevel(
IN pCustomerNumber INT,
OUT pCustomerLevel VARCHAR(20))
BEGIN
	DECLARE credit DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;

	SELECT creditLimit INTO credit FROM customers
		WHERE customerNumber = pCustomerNumber;

	IF credit <= 10000 THEN
		SET pCustomerLevel = 'SILVER';
	ELSEIF credit <= 50000 THEN
		SET pCustomerLevel = 'GOLD';
	ELSEIF credit > 50000 THEN
		SET pCustomerLevel = 'PLATINUM';
	END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
Case statement:
```sql
CASE country
	WHEN 'USA' THEN
		SET pShipping = '2-day shipping';
	WHEN 'Canada' THEN
		SET pShipping = '3-day shipping';
	ELSE
		SET pShipping = '5-day shipping';
END CASE;
```
Single-line trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER RecordDeletedCustomers
BEFORE DELETE ON Customers
FOR EACH ROW
	INSERT INTO CustomerAudit(deletedCustomerID, deletionTime)
	VALUES (OLD.customerID, NOW());
```
Multi-line trigger:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER AddNewOrderToActiveOrders
AFTER INSERT ON Orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
	DECLARE logSize INT;

	INSERT INTO ActiveOrders VALUES (NEW.XXX, NEW.YYY);
	
	SELECT COUNT(*) INTO logSize
		FROM ActiveOrders;
	IF logSize > 50 THEN
		CALL AlertTooManyUnfulfilledOrders(logSize);
	END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
Cursor:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE createEmailList(
	INOUT emailList varchar(4000)
)
BEGIN
	DECLARE finished INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
	DECLARE emailAddress varchar(100) DEFAULT "";
	-- declare cursor for employee email
	DECLARE curEmail CURSOR FOR
		SELECT email FROM employees;
	-- declare NOT FOUND handler
	DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER
		FOR NOT FOUND SET finished = 1;
	
	OPEN curEmail;
	getEmail: LOOP
		FETCH curEmail INTO emailAddress;
		IF finished = 1 THEN
			LEAVE getEmail;
		END IF;
		-- build email list
		SET emailList = CONCAT(emailAddress,";",emailList);
	END LOOP getEmail;
	CLOSE curEmail;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
