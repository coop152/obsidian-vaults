A transaction in a DBMS is a collection of operations that are connected such that they represent one single "action", or one unit of "work" as a whole. For example, a transaction may involve a single operation of simply adding a new row to a table, or it may involve multiple operations of retrieving some data, adding a new row and then updating an existing row. Transactions are **Atomic**, meaning that they may only be completed in their entirety or not at all; this is important for maintaining data integrity on a database, as if an action is not completed entirely (for example, one row is added but then another related row cannot be updated) then the database may be left in an invalid state. It is also important for concurrency, as if another user were to interact with data that is in the process of being changed, it could give incorrect or even invalid results.
